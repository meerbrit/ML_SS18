    "This exercise is supposed to be very easy, does not give any points, and is voluntary. There will be a similar exercise on every sheet. It is intended to revise some basic mathematical notions that are assumed throughout this class and to allow you to check if you are comfortable with them. Usually you should have no problem to answer these questions offhand, but if you feel unsure, this is a good time to look them up again. You are always welcome to discuss questions with the tutors or in the practice session. Also, if you have a (math) topic you would like to recap, please let us know."

    "The autocorrelation matrix $C$ allows to compute the variance of the projected data as $\\vec{p}^{T}C\\vec{p}$. We want to maximize this expression. To avoid $\\|\\vec{p}\\|\\to\\infty$ we will only consider unit vectors, i.e. we constrain $\\vec{p}$ to be normalized: $\\vec{p}^T\\vec{p}=1$. Maximize the expression with this constraint (which can be done using a Lagrangian multiplier). Conclude that a suitable $\\vec{p}$ has to be an eigenvector of $C$ and describe which of the eigenvectors is optimal."

    "Use an inductive argument: assume the statement has been shown for the $(m-1)$-dimensional projection space, spanned by the $m-1$ (orthonormal) eigenvectors $\\vec{p}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{p}_{m-1}$ corresponding to the $(m-1)$ largest eigenvalues $\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_{m-1}$. Now find a (unit) vector $\\vec{p}_m$, orthogonal to the existing vectors $\\vec{p}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{p}_{m-1}$, that maximizes the projected variance $\\vec{p}_m^TC\\vec{p}_m$. Proceed similar to case (a), but with additional Lagrangian multipliers to enforce the orthogonality constraint. Show that the new vector $\\vec{p}_m$ is an eigenvector of $C$. Finally show that the variance is maximized for the eigenvector corresponding to the $m$-th largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_m$."
